# Agrochemical Review README
Code repository for review and synthesis of agrochemical effects on schistosomiasis transmission 

## Response_Fxs  
Folder containing all data, code, and resulting plots used to estimate and analyze agrochemical response functions relating a particular model parameter

### Code  
Folder containing code used to fit dose-response functions  
### Data  
Folder containing data extracted from studies identified in review  
### Plots  
Plots of all data, fitted dose response functions, and results of sampling the d-r function with uncertainty  

## Models
Mathematical model, $R_0(q)$ function, parameter sets, and uncertainty analysis
## Sims
Code for simulating model and estimating $R_0$ in the presence of agrochemical pollution  
### EEC
Simulations and results at each agrochemical's Expected Environmental Concentration ($EEC$)
### Range
