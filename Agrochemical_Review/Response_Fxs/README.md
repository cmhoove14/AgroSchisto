### bakry2011_malathion_deltamethrin_snails_fit.R`  
Data from [Bakry et al 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048357511001283) investigating effect of **malathion** and **deltamethrin** on *Helisoma duryi* snail mortality and reproduction  
#### Data reported  
+ Table 1: LC50, confidence limits of LC50, slope function, LC0, LC10, LC25, LC90 corresponding to 24-hr mortality and estimated using litchfield and wilcoxon method for both malathion and deltamethrin
+ Figure 2: Longitudinal survival of control snail cohort and snail cohorts exposed to LC10 of malathion and deltamethrin
+ Table 2: Longitudinal egg production of control snail cohort and snail cohorts exposed to LC10 of malathion and deltamethrin
+ Tables 3,4,5: Physiological effects of exposure on enzymatic activity and biochemical measures  
#### Response functions fit  
+ Daily mortality rate for *H. duryi* exposed to malathion [Image]("Plots/Bakry_2011/bakry2011_malathion_snail_mortality.png")
+ Daily mortality rate for *H. duryi* exposed to deltamethrin [Image]("Plots/Bakry_2011/bakry2011_deltamethrin_snail_mortality.png") 
#### Notes
+ Longitudinal survival could be used to investigate effects of cumulative exposure with survival analysis
+ Snail reproduction (measured as eggs/snail at discrete times over a four week period) sharply reduced in snails exposed to LC10 of malathion and deltamethrin, but only able to compare control group to each exposed group, therefore unable to fit dose-response function [Image]("Plots/Bakry_2011/bakry2011_snail_reproduction.png")
