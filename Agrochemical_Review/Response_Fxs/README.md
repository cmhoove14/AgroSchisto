### `bakry2011_malathion_deltamethrin_snails_fit.R`  
Data from [Bakry et al 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048357511001283) investigating effect of **malathion** and **deltamethrin** on *Helisoma duryi* snail mortality and reproduction  
#### Data reported  
+ Table 1: LC50, confidence limits of LC50, slope function, LC0, LC10, LC25, LC90 corresponding to 24-hr mortality and estimated using litchfield and wilcoxon method for both malathion and deltamethrin
+ Figure 2: Longitudinal survival of control snail cohort and snail cohorts exposed to LC10 of malathion and deltamethrin
+ Table 2: Longitudinal egg production of control snail cohort and snail cohorts exposed to LC10 of malathion and deltamethrin
+ Tables 3,4,5: Physiological effects of exposure on enzymatic activity and biochemical measures  
#### Response functions fit  
+ Daily mortality rate for *H. duryi* exposed to malathion, produced from reported parameters derived using Litchfield and Wilcoxon method  
  + Function: `muNq_mal_Bakry11_uncertainty`  
  + Sampling and data: [Image](https://github.com/cmhoove14/AgroSchisto/blob/master/Agrochemical_Review/Response_Fxs/Plots/Bakry_2011/bakry2011_malathion_snail_mortality.png)  
+ Daily mortality rate for *H. duryi* exposed to deltamethrin, produced from reported parameters derived using Litchfield and Wilcoxon method  
  + Function: `muNq_del_Bakry11_uncertainty`  
  + Sampling and data: [Image](https://github.com/cmhoove14/AgroSchisto/blob/master/Agrochemical_Review/Response_Fxs/Plots/Bakry_2011/bakry2011_deltamethrin_snail_mortality.png)  
#### Notes
+ Longitudinal survival could be used to investigate effects of cumulative exposure with survival analysis
+ Snail reproduction (measured as eggs/snail at discrete times over a four week period) sharply reduced in snails exposed to LC10 of malathion and deltamethrin, but only able to compare control group to each exposed group, therefore unable to fit dose-response function [Image](https://github.com/cmhoove14/AgroSchisto/blob/master/Agrochemical_Review/Response_Fxs/Plots/Bakry_2011/bakry2011_snail_reproduction.png)

#### Notes
+ Longitudinal survival could be used to investigate effects of cumulative exposure with survival analysis
+ Snail reproduction (measured as eggs/snail in addition to hatchlings/snail at discrete times over a four week period) sharply reduced in snails exposed to LC10 of atrazine and glyphosate, but only able to compare control group to each exposed group, therefore unable to fit dose-response function [Image](https://github.com/cmhoove14/AgroSchisto/blob/master/Agrochemical_Review/Response_Fxs/Plots/Bakry_2012/bakry2012_snail_reproduction.png)

+ Snail population carrying capacity as a function of atrazine concentration, produced via a log-linear glm relating log+1 atrazine to peak growth rate

  + Sampling and data: [Image](https://github.com/cmhoove14/AgroSchisto/blob/master/Agrochemical_Review/Response_Fxs/Plots/Baxter_Rohr_2011/Baxter_rohr_atrazine_carrying_capacity_sim.png)
+ Snail population carrying capacity as a function of any herbicide concentration, assuming response is proportional to its EEC value and is the same as the atrazine response `phi_Nq_rel_baxrohr.no30`  
  + no30 refers to exclusion of data point at 30ppb atrazine due to large influence of spatial block on results.
