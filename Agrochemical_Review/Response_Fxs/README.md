Data from [Bakry et al 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048357511001283) investigating effect of **malathion** and **deltamethrin** on *Helisoma duryi* snail mortality and reproduction  
#### Data reported  
+ Table 1: LC50, confidence limits of LC50, slope function, LC0, LC10, LC25, LC90 corresponding to 24-hr mortality and estimated using litchfield and wilcoxon method for both malathion and deltamethrin
+ Figure 2: Longitudinal survival of control snail cohort and snail cohorts exposed to LC10 of malathion and deltamethrin
+ Table 2: Longitudinal egg production of control snail cohort and snail cohorts exposed to LC10 of malathion and deltamethrin
+ Tables 3,4,5: Physiological effects of exposure on enzymatic activity and biochemical measures  
#### Response functions fit  
+ Daily mortality rate for *H. duryi* exposed to malathion, produced from reported parameters derived using Litchfield and Wilcoxon method  
  + Function: `muNq_mal_Bakry11_uncertainty`  
  + Sampling and data: [Image](https://github.com/cmhoove14/AgroSchisto/blob/master/Agrochemical_Review/Response_Fxs/Plots/Bakry_2011/bakry2011_malathion_snail_mortality.png)

#### Notes
+ Longitudinal survival could be used to investigate effects of cumulative exposure with survival analysis
+ Snail reproduction (measured as eggs/snail at discrete times over a four week period) sharply reduced in snails exposed to LC10 of malathion and deltamethrin, but only able to compare control group to each exposed group, therefore unable to fit dose-response function [Image](https://github.com/cmhoove14/AgroSchisto/blob/master/Agrochemical_Review/Response_Fxs/Plots/Bakry_2011/bakry2011_snail_reproduction.png)

### `Ghaffar2016_butralin_glyphosate_pendimethalin_snails_fit.R`  
Data from [Abdel Ghaffar et al 2016](http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.4002/040.059.0201) investigating effect of **butralin**, **glyphosate**, and **pendimethalin** on *Biomphalaria alexandrina* snails  
#### Data reported  
+ Table 1: 24-hr LC0, LC10, LC25, LC50, LC50 95%CI, LC90, LC90 95%CI, and "Slope of refression mortality on conc."  
+ This data is highly questionable and reproducing dose-response relationships from it has not been completed. Cited method is Litchfield and Wilcoxon, but methods to reproduce d-r function from reported Litchfield and Wilcoxon parameters in other studies from the same authors are not working here. Almost seems like they the reported parameters come from a linear relationship fit to % mortality and concentration  

### `griggs08_atrazine_metolachlor_cercariae_fit.R`  
Data from [Griggs et al 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17763881) investigating effects of **atrazine** and **metloachlor** on *Echinistoma trivolvis* cercariae  
#### Data reported  
+ Fig 1: cercarial die off over time in water control, solvent control, low dose group, and high dose group. Low dose group contains 10ppb metolachlor **and** 15ppb atrazine; high dose group contains 85ppb metolachlor **and** 100ppb atrazine therefore other studies that estimate response to these chemicals alone and in schistosome (rather than *Echistoma*) will be prioritized  
#### Response functions fit  
+ cercarial survival as a function of metolachlor/atrazine concentration, produced via estimation of LC50 and slope parameters as a function of metolachlor/atrazine concentration incorporated into log-logistic d-r curve.
