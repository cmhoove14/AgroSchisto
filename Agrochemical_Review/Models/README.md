## `litchfield_wilcoxon_get_b1_from_slope`  
Brainstorming/process used to arrive at method for estimating the slope of an underlying linear model fit to probit transformed outcome and log10 transformed dose data (i.e. via the [litchfield and wilcoxon method](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/96/2/99)) when only the slp and lc50 parameters are reported  
+ .Rmd file contains notes and entire thought process used to produce the .pdf file
+ .R file contains the function loaded in response function fitting scripts
